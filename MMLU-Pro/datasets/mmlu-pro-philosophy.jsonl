The answer \u201cBglh\u201d appears in (J); therefore, (J) must be the correct answer. The answer is (J).\n\nQuestion: What is the sign of the covenant for Jewish males?\nOptions: A. Fasting on Yom Kippur\nB. Lighting Shabbat candles\nC. The rainbow\nD. Circumcision\nE. The Torah\nF. Bar mitzvah\nG. Keeping kosher\nH. Wearing a kippah\nI. A son\nJ. The Star of David\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on world religions for help. In Judaism, the most distinctive sign of the covenant is circumcision (brit milah). The answer is (D).\n\nQuestion: According to Moore\u2019s \u201cideal utilitarianism,\u201d the right action is the one that brings about the greatest amount of:\nOptions: A. wealth.\nB. virtue.\nC. fairness.\nD. pleasure.\nE. peace.\nF. justice.\nG. happiness.\nH. power.\nI. good.\nJ. knowledge.\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on philosophy for help. Moore's \"ideal utilitarianism\" states that one's actions should maximize intrinsic goods. The answer is (I).\n\nQuestion: Which of the given formulas of PL is the best symbolization of the following sentence?\nTurtles live long lives and are happy creatures, unless they are injured.\nOptions: A. (L \u2022 H) \u2261 I\nB. (L \u2022 H) \u2228 I\nC. L \u2022 (H \u2228 I)\nD. L \u2022 (H \u2283 R).\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on formal logic for help. Let\u2019s solve this step by step. Let \u201cL\u201d denote \u201cliving long\u201d, H \u201cbeing happy\u201d, and \u201cI\u201d \u201cbeing injured\u201d. Now, consider each choice:\n(A) means (living long AND being happy) is equivalent to (being injured). \n(B) means (living long AND being happy) OR (being injured). \n(C) means (living long) AND (being happy OR being injured). \n(D) means (living long) AND (being happy implies being R), but what R denotes is not clear.\nObviously, (B) is the best symbolization of the original sentence. The answer is (B).\n\nQuestion: Moore defines the naturalistic fallacy as the view that:\nOptions: A. everything that is natural is inherently bad.\nB. good is identical to an unnatural property.\nC. everything that is natural is good.\nD. good is identical to a natural property.\nE. natural properties and good are mutually exclusive.\nF. everything that is good is natural.\nG. good is a human-made concept, not natural.\nH. natural properties are inherently evil.\nI. all of the above.\nJ. the concept of good does not exist in nature.\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.", "answer": "D"}
