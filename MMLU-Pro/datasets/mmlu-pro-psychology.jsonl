TSD is based on the concept of 'thresholds' being fixed values, unlike the classical view which sees them as variable.\nH. TSD is a simpler approach than the classical psychophysical view\nI. The Theory of SignalDetectability(TSD) maintains that the classical view of the 'threshold' is an oversimplification. It argues that a subject's report of a signal presence tells two things: the ability to detect the stimulus and the motivation to detect it. The classical view only considers discrimination/detection/recognition ability.\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.", "answer": "I"}

Naturalistic observation-observing instances of online bullying by monitoring middle school students' social networking behavior would provide the most accurate data and not raise important privacy concerns, because social networks are considered \"public\" space.\nC. Content analysis - Analyzing the content of online messages and posts could provide insights into the nature and extent of online bullying.\nD. Cross-sectional study - Comparing different groups of students at the same point in time would provide insights into how online bullying behavior varies across different ages, grades, or other demographic factors.\nE. Survey-self-reports about online bullying behaviors and responses to these behaviors would likely provide the most accurate descriptions of bullying and its impact.\nF. Case study - Studying a specific instance of online bullying in detail will provide the most comprehensive understanding of the behavior.\nG.

Over the year, she has become fluent in social English. After a few months in a monolingual English second grade, her teacher refers her for evaluation because she has great difficulty with the basal reader used in the class. Two English proficiency tests administered to the student show that she performs above the mean for monolingual English grade peers in speaking and listening but well below the mean in reading and writing. She also performs well above the mean for grade peers on reading tests in her native language. Based on this information alone, which of the following is the most accurate interpretation?\nOptions: A.  The discrepancy between the student's native language reading skills and English reading skills is related to the greater complexity of English.\nB. The discrepancy between the student's native language reading skills and English reading skills is due to the different teaching methodologies in her previous and current schools.\nC. The student's high scores in reading in her native language are misleading her actual reading capacity in English.\nD. The student's reading difficulty is due to her inability to adjust to the new learning environment.\nE. The student's difficulty in reading is due to lack of exposure to English literature.\nF. The student's reading skills are being hindered due to her proficiency in speaking and listening.\nG. The discrepancy between the student's English social language skills and reading skills is expected given the richer context in which social skills are acquired.\nH.
